# V-Module-Max-for-Live-Video-Plugins
Max for Live Video Plugins with 3D engine support (Ableton Live)

V-Module is a collection of Max for Live devices for real-time video content creation and processing within Ableton Live. It works on top of Live and is essentially a Live-like interface to Jitter functionalities in Max (along with a few creations of mine). V-Module is currently free (of course you must own Ableton Live and Max for Live licences in order to be able to use it) and available under a Creative Common “No Derivative Works” license.
